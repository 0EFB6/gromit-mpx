- device specific hotkey
  ->  this is really awkward, because i had to duplicate the event 
      handling in gromit (gdk gives no device information with key 
      events. and two event checkers running ain't nice: either we
      miss XI key events or internal gdk events (arrows arent drawn
      till the end...) so just leave it till gdk gets full XI2.
  ->  see gromit.c_devhotkeytry3 for the third stab on this...
